What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The cons are that you may forget to save
and unexpected interruptions send you back to square one

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Some were created as general purpose software, others were created to solve specific programming probjems

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Dont stress me please. go figure

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
