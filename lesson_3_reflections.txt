When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories can make it easier to work with teams or help you continue working accross several machines

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

collaborative work may mean changes to the remote repo that you dont necessarily want on your local repo
an automatic pull process might end up messing up your work and leaving you clueless as why
